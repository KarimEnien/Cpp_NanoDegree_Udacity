Quiz: get() vs. wait()
There are some situations where it might be interesting to separate the waiting for the content from the actual retrieving. Futures allow us to do that using the wait() function. This method will block until the future is ready. Once it returns, it is guaranteed that data is available and we can use get() to retrieve it without delay.

In addition to wait, the C++ standard also offers the method wait_for, which takes a time duration as an input and also waits for a result to become available. The method wait_for() will block either until the specified timeout duration has elapsed or the result becomes available - whichever comes first. The return value identifies the state of the result.

In the following example, please use the wait_for method to wait for the availability of a result for one second. After the time has passed (or the result is available) print the result to the console. Should the time be up without the result being available, print an error message to the console instead.
