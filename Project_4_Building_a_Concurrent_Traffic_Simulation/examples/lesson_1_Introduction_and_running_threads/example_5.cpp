Using join() as a barrier

In the previous example, the order of execution is determined by the scheduler. If we wanted to ensure that the thread function completed its work before the main function started its own work (because it might be waiting for a result to be available), we could achieve this by repositioning the call to join.

In the file on the right, the .join() has been moved to before the work in main()
